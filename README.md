# RandomScripts
Random coded scripts for RNA-Seq Simulation and Analysis.

## RNA-Seq Data Simulation 
1. To simulate RNA sequencing reads using Flux Simulator program, you need two files, annotation file and chromosomes file.
2. To download gene annotation file for human from Gencode, [release 17] (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/gencode/Gencode_human/release_17/gencode.v17.annotation.gtf.gz)
